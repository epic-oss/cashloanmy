Every time you apply for a loan, banks check your CCRIS and CTOS. These reports tell them your financial history — the good, the bad, and the ugly. Understanding what's in these reports is the first step to getting approved.

<Callout type="info" title="Check Before You Apply">
Never apply for a loan without checking your CCRIS and CTOS first. Surprises in your credit report lead to rejections that stay on record for 12 months.
</Callout>

## CCRIS vs CTOS — Quick Overview

| | CCRIS | CTOS |
|---|-------|------|
| **Full name** | Central Credit Reference Information System | Credit Tip-Off Service |
| **Run by** | Bank Negara Malaysia | Private company (CTOS Data Systems) |
| **What it shows** | Bank loans & credit facilities | Loans + legal cases + trade references |
| **Has a score?** | No — just records | Yes — CTOS Score (300-850) |
| **Cost to check** | Free | RM24.85 - RM50 |
| **How to check** | eCCRIS online | MyCTOS website/app |

**Banks check both.** CCRIS first (mandatory), then CTOS for additional info.

## How to Check Your CCRIS (Free)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Go to eCCRIS:** https://eccris.bnm.gov.my
2. **Register** with your IC number and mobile number
3. **Verify** via OTP sent to your phone
4. **Login** and view your report instantly

### What You'll See in CCRIS

**Section 1: Outstanding Credit**
- All active loans and credit cards
- Credit limits and outstanding balances
- Monthly payment amounts

**Section 2: Payment History (12 months)**
- Payment conduct codes (0, 1, 2, 3...)
- Shows if you paid on time or late
- Most important section for approval

**Section 3: Special Attention Accounts**
- Accounts with serious problems
- Defaults, legal action, restructured loans
- Major red flag if anything appears here

**Section 4: Credit Applications**
- Every loan you've applied for
- Approved and rejected applications
- Banks see if you've been "shopping around"

<Callout type="warning" title="Application History Matters">
Banks can see your last 12 months of loan applications. Too many applications (especially rejections) signal desperation and hurt your chances.
</Callout>

## How to Read CCRIS Payment Codes

Your payment history shows a code for each month:

| Code | Meaning | What Banks Think |
|------|---------|------------------|
| 0 | Paid on time | Good |
| 1 | 1-29 days late | Minor concern |
| 2 | 30-59 days late | Warning sign |
| 3 | 60-89 days late | Red flag |
| 4-9 | 90+ days late | Serious problem |
| X | No payment required | Neutral |

**Example payment history:**

```
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
0   0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
```

This shows one late payment in April — explainable and usually not a deal-breaker.

**Bad example:**

```
Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
0   1   2   1   0   1   0   2   1   0   0   0
```

Multiple late payments = pattern of poor financial management = likely rejection.

## How to Check Your CTOS

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Go to:** https://ctoscredit.com.my
2. **Sign up** for MyCTOS account
3. **Choose a plan:**
   - MyCTOS Basic: RM24.85 (score + summary)
   - MyCTOS Premium: RM49.90 (full report)
4. **Verify identity** (IC upload or video verification)
5. **View your report** immediately

### What You'll See in CTOS

**CTOS Score (300-850)**
- Your overall creditworthiness number
- Higher = better
- Banks use this as quick reference

**Credit Information**
- Same as CCRIS (loans, payment history)
- May include non-bank credit (AEON, Courts, etc.)

**Legal Cases**
- Court judgments against you
- Bankruptcy records
- Trade disputes

**Directorship Info**
- Companies you're director of
- Relevant for business loan applications

**Address History**
- Past addresses linked to your IC
- Helps verify your identity

## Understanding Your CTOS Score

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 750-850 | Excellent | Best rates, easy approval |
| 700-749 | Good | Most loans approved |
| 650-699 | Fair | Approved with conditions |
| 600-649 | Poor | Limited options, higher rates |
| 300-599 | Very Poor | Difficult to get any loan |

<Callout type="tip" title="Score vs Record">
A good score with a recent default still gets rejected. Banks look at both the score AND the details. Don't just focus on the number.
</Callout>

## What Makes Banks Reject You

### Automatic Rejection Triggers

These usually mean instant rejection:

<ProsConsTable
  pros={[
    "12 months of '0' payment codes",
    "No special attention accounts",
    "Low credit utilization",
    "Few recent credit applications",
    "No legal cases or bankruptcy"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Any code '3' or higher in past 12 months",
    "Account in 'special attention'",
    "Bankruptcy (even discharged recently)",
    "Active legal case related to debt",
    "Multiple rejections in past 6 months"
  ]}
/>

### Yellow Flags (Case-by-Case)

These may or may not cause rejection:
- One or two '1' codes in past 12 months
- High credit utilization (above 70%)
- Recently settled default accounts
- AKPK participation (some banks accept)
- Multiple credit applications (3+ in 6 months)

## Common Issues Found in Reports

### Issue 1: Wrong Information

**Problem:** Account shows as unpaid but you paid it.

**Solution:**
1. Get proof of payment (receipt, bank statement)
2. Contact the bank that reported the error
3. Request correction in writing
4. Follow up in 2-4 weeks

### Issue 2: Account That Isn't Yours

**Problem:** Loan appears that you never took.

**Solution:**
1. Possible fraud — report to the lender immediately
2. File police report
3. Contact CCRIS/CTOS to dispute
4. May need to provide IC and proof of address

### Issue 3: Old Settled Account Still Showing

**Problem:** Paid off loan years ago still appears as active.

**Solution:**
1. Get settlement letter from the lender
2. Submit to CCRIS/CTOS for update
3. Allow 2-4 weeks for correction

### Issue 4: Same Debt Listed Twice

**Problem:** Duplicate entry inflating your total debt.

**Solution:**
1. Identify the duplicate accounts
2. Contact the reporting bank
3. Request removal of duplicate entry

<Callout type="info" title="Dispute Timeline">
CCRIS corrections go through the reporting bank (2-4 weeks). CTOS disputes can be filed directly through MyCTOS and typically resolve in 14-30 days.
</Callout>

## How to Dispute Errors

### CCRIS Dispute Process

1. **Identify the error** in your report
2. **Contact the bank** that reported the information (not Bank Negara)
3. **Provide evidence:** payment receipts, settlement letters, bank statements
4. **Submit written request** for correction
5. **Bank investigates** and updates CCRIS if valid
6. **Check your report** again after 2-4 weeks

### CTOS Dispute Process

1. **Log in** to MyCTOS account
2. **Click "Dispute"** next to incorrect information
3. **Upload supporting documents**
4. **CTOS contacts** the data provider
5. **Resolution** within 14-30 days
6. **Notification** when dispute is resolved

## How Often Should You Check?

| Situation | How Often |
|-----------|-----------|
| Normal maintenance | Every 6 months |
| Before applying for loan | 1-2 weeks before |
| After paying off debt | 1 month after to verify update |
| Suspected fraud | Immediately |
| After rejection | Before next application |

## Improving Your CCRIS/CTOS Record

### Short Term (1-3 Months)

- Pay all bills before due date
- Pay more than minimum on credit cards
- Don't apply for new credit
- Dispute any errors immediately

### Medium Term (3-6 Months)

- Maintain perfect '0' payment history
- Reduce credit card balances
- Let old negative records age
- Build positive payment history

### Long Term (6-12 Months)

- Negative marks become less impactful over time
- 12 months of good conduct shows rehabilitation
- Some records expire after certain periods
- Consistent good behavior matters most

## What If Your Record Is Bad?

Don't panic. Options still exist:

1. **Wait and rebuild** — 12 months of perfect payments changes everything
2. **Licensed money lenders** — Check CCRIS but more lenient
3. **Secured loans** — Collateral reduces lender risk
4. **Joint application** — Partner with someone who has good credit
5. **AKPK** — If overwhelmed, get professional debt help

## CCRIS/CTOS Myths Debunked

**Myth:** Checking your own report hurts your score.
**Truth:** Self-checks are "soft inquiries" with no impact.

**Myth:** Paying off a loan removes it from CCRIS.
**Truth:** It stays as positive history (which is good).

**Myth:** After 7 years, everything is wiped clean.
**Truth:** Malaysia doesn't have a fixed expiry like the US. Records can stay longer.

**Myth:** CTOS score is the only thing that matters.
**Truth:** Banks look at full details, not just the score.

**Myth:** You can pay to "clean" your CCRIS.
**Truth:** Scam. Only legitimate corrections through proper channels work.

## Bottom Line

Your CCRIS and CTOS reports are your financial CV. Banks judge you by what's in them.

1. **Check regularly** — Know what banks will see
2. **Fix errors immediately** — Wrong info costs you approvals
3. **Build good history** — Time and good behavior heal bad records
4. **Check before applying** — Never be surprised by your own report

Take control of your credit record. Your future loan approvals depend on it.
