Not all banks are equally strict. Some approve more easily than others. If you've been rejected before, knowing which bank to try next can save you time and protect your credit record.

<Callout type="info" title="Why This Matters">
Every loan application creates an inquiry on your CCRIS. Too many rejections hurt your credit. Apply strategically — start with banks most likely to approve you.

## Interest Rate Comparison

| Maybank | 5.0% - 8.0% | ~RM7,000 total interest |
| CIMB | 5.5% - 9.0% | ~RM8,000 total interest |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Applying to strictest bank first** — Start with banks likely to approve you
2. **Multiple applications at once** — Each shows on CCRIS
3. **Not checking DSR first** — Calculate before applying
4. **Incomplete documents** — Causes delays and sometimes rejection
5. **Applying right after rejection** — Wait 3-6 months

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which bank has highest approval rate for personal loan in Malaysia?
Bank Rakyat (especially for government servants) and AEON Credit have the highest approval rates due to more flexible requirements.

### Can I get a personal loan with RM2,000 salary?
Yes. Bank Rakyat, AEON Credit, and RHB accept applicants with RM2,000 minimum income. Your DSR must still be acceptable.

### Which bank is best for first-time borrowers?
AEON Credit or your existing salary bank. First-time borrowers benefit from building a relationship first.

No. Each application creates a CCRIS inquiry. Apply strategically to one bank at a time, starting with the most likely to approve.

### How long should I wait after rejection before trying another bank?
Wait at least 1-3 months. Use that time to understand why you were rejected and fix the issue.
