TNG GOpinjam is one of the most searched loan options in Malaysia. But unlike bank loans, you can't just apply — you need to be "invited." Here's everything you need to know about getting and using GOpinjam.

<Callout type="info" title="What is GOpinjam?">
GOpinjam is Touch 'n Go eWallet's personal financing feature. It offers loans up to RM10,000 directly through the TNG app. Not everyone sees this option — it's offered to selected users based on their TNG usage history.
</Callout>

## TNG GOpinjam Overview

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Provider | Touch 'n Go (licensed under Bank Negara) |
| Min Amount | RM500 |
| Max Amount | RM10,000 |
| Tenure | 3 - 12 months |
| Interest Rate | 12% - 18% p.a. (varies by profile) |
| Disbursement | To TNG wallet or bank account |
| Approval Time | Minutes to hours |

## Interest Rates {{year}}

| Profile | Estimated Rate |
|---------|----------------|
| Excellent TNG user | 12% - 14% p.a. |
| Good TNG user | 14% - 16% p.a. |
| Average TNG user | 16% - 18% p.a. |

**Note:** Rates are assigned based on your TNG usage behavior, repayment history (if previous loan), and risk assessment. You cannot negotiate rates.

### Cost Example

RM5,000 loan for 12 months at 15% p.a.:
- Monthly payment: ~RM452
- Total repayment: ~RM5,424
- Total interest: ~RM424

Compared to banks (8%): You'd pay ~RM200 less with a bank. But GOpinjam is faster and easier to access.

## How to Get GOpinjam

Here's the truth: **You cannot directly apply for GOpinjam.** It appears as an option for selected users.

### Step 1: Use TNG eWallet Actively

The algorithm looks at:
- How often you reload and spend
- Bill payments through TNG
- DuitNow transfers
- GO+ (investment feature) usage
- Length of time as TNG user

### Step 2: Complete Your Profile

Make sure you have:
- Verified IC (eKYC completed)
- Linked bank account
- Updated personal information
- Phone number verified

### Step 3: Check the App Regularly

GOpinjam appears under:
- Home screen as a banner/card
- "Wealth" section
- Or as a notification

### Step 4: Wait

There's no guaranteed timeline. Some users get it within months, others never see it.

<Callout type="tip" title="How to Increase Your Chances">
Use TNG for everything — tolls, parking, bills, DuitNow transfers, retail payments. The more active you are, the more data TNG has to assess you. Also use GO+ savings feature — it shows financial responsibility.
</Callout>

## Why You Might Not See GOpinjam

| Reason | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| New TNG user | Wait and use actively for 3-6 months |
| Low activity | Increase TNG usage for payments |
| Incomplete profile | Complete eKYC and verification |
| Poor previous repayment | If you had GOpinjam before and paid late, you may be excluded |
| High risk profile | TNG's algorithm assessed you as risky |

Once GOpinjam appears, you'll need:
- Malaysian citizen (age 18-60)
