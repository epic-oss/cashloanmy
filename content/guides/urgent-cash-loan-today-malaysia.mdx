You need money today. Not tomorrow, not next week — today. This guide is for genuine emergencies when you need cash within 24 hours.

<Callout type="warning" title="Before You Continue">
Urgent borrowing is expensive. Only proceed if this is a true emergency — medical bills, preventing eviction, or avoiding serious financial damage. For non-urgent needs, wait for better rates.

## Your 24-Hour Action Plan

Here's exactly what to do, hour by hour:

### Hour 1-2: Check What You Already Have

Before borrowing, exhaust free options:

**Check immediately:**
- Credit card available balance (cash advance)
- EPF Account 2 (emergency withdrawal takes 3-5 days, but start now)
- TNG GOpinjam / ShopeePay Pinjam (if you have these apps)
- AEON iCash (if you're an AEON member)

**Ask today:**
- Employer salary advance
- Family members (swallow pride, it's free money)
- Close friends (short-term, with clear repayment date)

### Hour 2-4: Apply to Fastest Legitimate Options

If you must borrow, do this in parallel:

**Option A: Digital Lenders (Small Amounts)**

Apply to all that you qualify for:

| App | Max Amount | Speed | Requirement |
|-----|------------|-------|-------------|
| TNG GOpinjam | RM10,000 | Hours | Active TNG user |
| ShopeePay Pinjam | RM5,000 | Hours | Shopee account |
| Atome | RM3,000 | Hours | Existing user |
| AEON iCash | RM20,000 | Instant | AEON member |

**Option B: Licensed Money Lenders (Larger Amounts)**

For amounts above RM10,000 or if you're rejected by digital lenders:

1. Google "licensed money lender near me"
2. Verify license at Kementerian Perumahan (KPKT) website
3. Call ahead — ask "Can I get approval today if I come now?"
4. Bring all documents (see checklist below)

### Hour 4-6: In-Person Application

If digital options failed, visit a licensed money lender:

**Document checklist — bring originals AND copies:**
- MyKad (IC)
- Latest 3 months pay slips
- Latest 3 months bank statements
- Employment confirmation letter
- Utility bill (proof of address)

<Callout type="tip" title="Speed Tip">
Call before visiting. Ask: "I have all documents ready. If I come now, can I get approval and cash today?" This filters out slow lenders.
</Callout>

### Hour 6-12: Disbursement

If approved:
- Digital lenders: Transfer to your bank within 1-4 hours
- Money lenders: Cash or instant transfer same day
- Some may only disburse next business day (ask upfront)

## Realistic Expectations

Let's be honest about what's possible:

| Amount Needed | Same-Day Possible? | Best Option |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Under RM1,000 | Yes | Digital apps, credit card |
| RM1,000-5,000 | Yes | Digital apps, money lender |
| RM5,000-20,000 | Likely | Licensed money lender |
| RM20,000-50,000 | Maybe | Money lender (with good docs) |
| Above RM50,000 | Unlikely | Banks need 3-7 days minimum |

## The Cost of Urgency

Fast money is expensive money:

<ProsConsTable
  pros={[
    "Get cash when you desperately need it",
    "Avoid worse consequences (eviction, medical delay)",
    "Some emergencies can't wait",
    "Licensed lenders are regulated"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Interest rates 12-18% vs bank's 6-8%",
    "Processing fees may apply",
    "Smaller loan limits",
    "May require collateral for large amounts"
  ]}
/>

**Example cost difference:**

RM10,000 loan for 2 years:
- Bank (8% p.a.): Total repayment ~RM10,800
- Money lender (18% p.a.): Total repayment ~RM11,800

**Urgency premium: RM1,000 extra**

Is your emergency worth RM1,000? Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

## What Counts as a Real Emergency?

**Worth paying urgency premium:**
- Medical treatment that can't wait
- Preventing car repossession (need car for work)
- Emergency home repairs (roof leak, broken pipes)
- Legal matters with deadlines

**NOT worth paying urgency premium:**
- Gadget purchases
- Holiday bookings
- Investment "opportunities"
- Covering previous debt payments

<Callout type="danger" title="Debt Spiral Warning">
If you're borrowing urgently to pay another loan, STOP. You're entering a debt spiral. Seek debt counseling (AKPK) instead of more loans.
</Callout>

## Scams That Target Desperate Borrowers

When you're desperate, scammers know you'll take risks. Watch for:

### The "Processing Fee" Scam
- "Approved! Just pay RM500 processing fee first"
- Legitimate lenders deduct fees from disbursement, never ask upfront

### The "Guarantee Approval" Scam
- "100% approval regardless of credit!"
- No legitimate lender approves everyone

### The WhatsApp/Telegram Lender
- No office, no website, just a phone number
- They'll get your IC, then disappear (or worse, steal your identity)

### The "Agent" Middleman
- Claims to have connections at banks
- Charges fee to "process" your application
- Banks don't work with random agents

**Rule:** If it sounds too easy, it's a scam.

## If You Can't Get Approved Today

Sometimes even urgent loans take time. Backup options:

### Buy Yourself 24-48 Hours
- Call whoever you owe money to — explain, ask for extension
- Most landlords, hospitals, businesses prefer late payment over non-payment
- A phone call can buy you time to get proper financing

### Pawn Shops (Pajak Gadai)
- Instant cash for valuables
- Gold, electronics, vehicles
- Get your items back when you repay

### Sell Something
- Carousell, Facebook Marketplace
- Price low for quick sale
- Electronics, furniture, collectibles

### Gig Economy
- Grab, Foodpanda, Lalamove
- Won't solve today's problem, but can help repayment

3. Have all your documents ready
4. Visit licensed money lenders in person
