## Loan Apps vs Banks — When to Use Which

| Use Loan Apps When | Use Banks When |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Need under RM10,000 | Need RM20,000+ |
| Need money within 24 hours | Can wait 3-7 days |
| Banks rejected you | You qualify for bank rates |
| Building credit history | Want lowest rates (6-8%) |

## How to Choose the Right App

1. **Check if you're already a user** — TNG, Shopee, AEON users have advantages
2. **Compare interest rates** — Calculate total repayment, not just monthly
3. **Read the permissions** — Avoid apps wanting contact/photo access
4. **Start small** — Don't max out on first loan
5. **Have repayment plan** — Late fees add up fast

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which loan app has the lowest interest rate?
TNG GOpinjam and AEON iCash typically offer the lowest rates (12-18% p.a.) among loan apps. However, banks still offer better rates (6-8%) if you qualify.

### Which loan app is easiest to get approved?
Apps like Nimbura and Bolt Loan have lower requirements, but this comes with higher interest rates. Easier approval = more risk for lender = higher rates for you.

### Are loan apps safe in Malaysia?
Major apps (TNG, AEON, Atome) backed by established companies are safe. Avoid unknown apps that ask for upfront fees or excessive permissions.

### Can I use multiple loan apps at once?
Technically yes, but not recommended. Multiple loans = higher DSR = harder to manage = debt spiral risk.

### What's better — loan app or licensed money lender?
Licensed money lenders can offer higher amounts (up to RM50,000+) and are regulated. Apps are more convenient for small amounts. Both are more expensive than banks.
