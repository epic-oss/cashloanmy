## Can I Get a Loan Immediately?

People often ask about "instant" loans. Here's the reality:

### Same Day Possible

| Amount | Same Day Option |
|--------|-----------------|
| RM1,000-3,000 | Loan apps, Ar-Rahnu, credit card |
| RM3,000-5,000 | Loan apps, licensed lender, AEON |
| RM5,000-10,000 | Licensed lender, AEON, CIMB Cash Plus |
| RM10,000-20,000 | Licensed lender (with complete docs) |
| RM20,000+ | Unlikely same day |

### What "Instant" Actually Means

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Instant approval" | Decision in minutes, money in hours |
| "Same day" | Apply morning, receive by evening |
| "24 hours" | Apply today, receive tomorrow |
| "Fast" | 1-3 days (still faster than banks) |

## What Affects Your Loan Amount?

### Factors That INCREASE Your Limit

- Higher salary
- Lower existing debt (DSR)
- Clean CCRIS record
- Longer employment tenure
- Existing relationship with lender
- Collateral/guarantor

### Factors That DECREASE Your Limit

- Low income
- High existing commitments
- Late payment history
- Short employment tenure
- Self-employed (harder to verify)
- Multiple recent applications

## Calculate Your Realistic Loan Amount

### Step 1: Know Your DSR

**DSR = (Total Monthly Debt ÷ Net Income) × 100**

Example:
- Net income: RM4,000
- Car loan: RM600
- Credit card (5% of RM10,000): RM500
- Total debt: RM1,100
- Current DSR: 27.5%

### Step 2: Calculate Available DSR

Banks allow up to 60-70% DSR:
- Maximum DSR: 60%
- Current DSR: 27.5%
- Available: 32.5%

### Step 3: Calculate Max New Payment

- Available DSR: 32.5%
- Income: RM4,000
- Max new payment: RM4,000 × 32.5% = **RM1,300/month**

### Step 4: Translate to Loan Amount

With RM1,300/month payment capacity:
- 3 years at 8%: ~RM41,000
- 5 years at 8%: ~RM64,000
- 7 years at 8%: ~RM85,000

<Callout type="tip" title="Quick Estimate">
As a rough guide: Your max loan ≈ Monthly payment capacity × Tenure in months × 0.85 (accounting for interest).
</Callout>

## What If You Need More Than You Qualify For?

### Option 1: Reduce Existing Debt

- Pay off credit cards
- Settle small loans
- Close unused credit facilities
- Lower credit card limits

### Option 2: Add Guarantor/Co-Applicant

- Spouse, parent, or sibling
- Their income adds to yours
- Both responsible for repayment

### Option 3: Provide Collateral

- Fixed Deposit (borrow up to 90%)
- Property (home equity loan)
- Vehicle (car collateral loan)

### Option 4: Apply with Spouse

Joint application combines:
- Both incomes
- Both credit histories
- Higher loan amount possible

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get RM5,000 with RM1,500 salary?
Possible through AEON or licensed money lenders, but your monthly payment must fit within DSR limits. Expect longer tenure to make payments affordable.

### Which bank gives highest loan amount?
Maybank offers up to RM250,000. But your actual limit depends on income, not the bank's maximum.

### Can unemployed get RM10,000 loan?
Very difficult. Without income, only asset-backed options work (Ar-Rahnu, FD-backed loan). See our [unemployed loan guide](/guides/loan-for-unemployed-malaysia).

### How fast can I get RM20,000?
Licensed money lender: 1-2 days with complete documents. Banks: 3-7 days minimum.

### Why was I approved for less than I requested?
Banks cap your amount based on DSR calculation. If you asked for RM30,000 but got RM20,000 approved, your income/debt ratio limits you to RM20,000.

### Can I get two loans to reach my target amount?
Possible but risky. The second lender will see your first loan in CCRIS, raising your DSR and possibly causing rejection.
