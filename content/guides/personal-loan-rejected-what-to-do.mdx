Getting rejected for a personal loan can be frustrating and stressful. But here's the truth — **rejection isn't the end**. Many Malaysians successfully get approved after understanding why they were rejected and taking the right steps.

<Callout type="info" title="You're Not Alone">
Bank Negara data shows that roughly 30-40% of personal loan applications in Malaysia get rejected. The good news? Most rejections are fixable.

## Why Banks Reject Personal Loan Applications

Before you reapply, you need to understand what went wrong. Here are the most common reasons:

### 1. Debt Service Ratio (DSR) Too High

Your DSR is the percentage of your income that goes toward debt repayments. Most banks want this below **60-70%**.

**Example:** If you earn RM5,000/month and your existing commitments (car loan, credit card, PTPTN) total RM3,500, your DSR is 70% — borderline or too high for most banks.

### 2. Poor Credit Score (CCRIS/CTOS)

Banks check your credit history through CCRIS and CTOS. Red flags include:
- Late payments in the past 12 months
- Outstanding defaults
- Legal cases or bankruptcy records
- Too many recent loan applications

### 3. Incomplete or Wrong Documents

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistake">
Many rejections happen simply because of missing payslips, wrong IC copies, or incomplete bank statements. Always double-check before submitting.

### 4. Income Not Properly Presented

Self-employed applicants and those with commission-based income often struggle because banks can't verify stable earnings.

## What To Do After Getting Rejected

<DynamicYear /> is a good time to reassess and try again. Here's your action plan:

### Step 1: Get Your CCRIS and CTOS Report

Before anything else, check your actual credit standing. You can get:
- **CCRIS report** from Bank Negara (free)
- **CTOS report** from CTOS website (RM25-50)

### Step 2: Calculate Your Real DSR

Add up all your monthly commitments and divide by your gross income. If it's above 60%, focus on paying down existing debt first.

### Step 3: Fix What You Can Fix

    "Pay off small debts to lower DSR",

  cons={[
    "Applying to many banks at once (hurts your score)",

    "Using unlicensed money lenders"
  ]}

### Step 4: Consider Alternative Approaches

If traditional banks keep rejecting you, there are legitimate options:

1. **Ask for a lower amount** — Sometimes you qualify for RM10k but not RM30k
2. **Add a guarantor** — A family member with good credit can help
3. **Try different banks** — Each bank has different risk appetite
4. **Work with a loan specialist** — They know which banks suit your profile

## How Long Should You Wait Before Reapplying?

<Callout type="tip" title="Timing Matters">
Wait at least **3-6 months** before reapplying to the same bank. Each application creates an inquiry on your credit report, and too many inquiries signal desperation to lenders.
</Callout>

## Bottom Line

Loan rejection isn't permanent. Most people who get rejected can eventually get approved by:
1. Understanding the real reason for rejection
2. Taking 3-6 months to fix the issues
3. Applying strategically to the right bank

Don't give up — and don't resort to unlicensed money lenders (ah longs). There's always a legitimate path forward.
