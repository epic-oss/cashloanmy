"Your DSR is too high" — if you've heard this from a bank, you're not alone. Debt Service Ratio is the #1 reason loan applications get rejected in Malaysia, yet most people don't understand it until it's too late.

This guide explains exactly what DSR is, how to calculate yours, and what to do if it's too high.

<Callout type="info" title="What is DSR?">
DSR (Debt Service Ratio) measures how much of your income goes toward debt payments. Banks use it to determine if you can afford another loan.
</Callout>

## The DSR Formula

It's simple math:

**DSR = (Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Net Monthly Income) × 100**

**Example:**
- Monthly income: RM5,000
- Car loan: RM800
- Credit card minimum: RM300
- PTPTN: RM200
- Total debt: RM1,300

**DSR = (1,300 ÷ 5,000) × 100 = 26%**

This person has a healthy DSR and would likely get approved.

## What Counts as "Debt" in DSR?

Banks include these in your debt calculation:

| Included | Monthly Amount Used |
|----------|-------------------|
| Car loan | Full installment |
| House loan | Full installment |
| Personal loan | Full installment |
| PTPTN | Monthly payment (or estimated) |
| Credit card | 5% of outstanding balance |
| Hire purchase | Full installment |
| AEON/Courts installments | Full payment |
| Existing overdraft | Minimum payment |

<Callout type="warning" title="Credit Card Trap">
Even if you pay in full monthly, banks calculate 5% of your credit limit or outstanding balance as your "commitment." High credit limits hurt your DSR even if you don't use them.
</Callout>

## What's Your Net Income?

Banks calculate income differently:

| Employment Type | How Banks Calculate |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Salaried (private) | Basic salary + fixed allowances (usually 70-90% of gross) |
| Government | Gross salary (100%) |
| Self-employed | Average of 6-12 months bank deposits (50-70% accepted) |
| Commission-based | Basic + average commission (varies by bank) |

**Example — Private sector:**
- Gross salary: RM6,000
- EPF deduction: RM660
- SOCSO: RM70
- Tax: RM200
- Net for DSR: ~RM5,070 (or bank may use 80% of gross = RM4,800)

## DSR Limits by Bank

Different banks have different thresholds:

| Bank | Maximum DSR |
|------|-------------|
| Maybank | 60-70% |
| CIMB | 60-70% |
| Public Bank | 60% |
| RHB | 65-70% |
| Hong Leong | 60-70% |
| AmBank | 70% |
| Bank Rakyat | 60-65% |
| Licensed Money Lenders | Up to 80% |

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Government servants often get higher DSR allowances (up to 75-80%) because of job stability. If you're a civil servant, ask specifically about your limit.

## Calculate Your DSR Right Now

Let's do this step by step:

### Step 1: List All Monthly Debt Payments

| Debt Type | Your Amount |
|-----------|-------------|
| Car loan | RM_______ |
| House loan | RM_______ |
| Personal loan | RM_______ |
| PTPTN | RM_______ |
| Credit card (5% of balance) | RM_______ |
| Other installments | RM_______ |
| **Total Monthly Debt** | **RM_______** |

### Step 2: Calculate Net Income

For employed: Take-home pay after EPF, SOCSO, tax
For self-employed: Average monthly bank deposits × 60%

**Your Net Income: RM_______**

### Step 3: Calculate DSR

**Your DSR = (Total Debt ÷ Net Income) × 100 = _______%**

## What Your DSR Means

| Your DSR | Status | Loan Approval Chances |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Below 40% | Excellent | Very high — best rates |
| 40-50% | Good | High — most banks approve |
| 50-60% | Moderate | Approved with conditions |
| 60-70% | Borderline | Some banks only |
| Above 70% | High | Difficult — need alternatives |

## DSR Too High? Here's How to Lower It

### Option 1: Reduce Existing Debt

<ProsConsTable
  pros={[
    "Pay off smallest loans first (removes from DSR)",
    "Settle credit card balances",
    "Reduce credit card limits",
    "Refinance to longer tenure (lower monthly)",
    "Close unused credit facilities"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Taking new loans to pay old loans",
    "Ignoring the problem hoping it goes away",
    "Applying to more banks (adds inquiries)",
    "Using unlicensed lenders"
  ]}
/>

### Option 2: Increase Income (On Paper)

- Include all income sources in application
- Provide proof of overtime, bonuses, commissions
- Add freelance income with bank statements
- Include rental income if any
- Declare spouse's income for joint application

### Option 3: Apply Strategically

**Choose the right bank:**
- Each bank calculates DSR slightly differently
- Some are more lenient on certain income types
- Government servant? Go to Bank Rakyat
- Self-employed? Try CIMB or Maybank

**Reduce loan amount:**
- Lower loan = lower monthly payment = lower DSR impact
- Sometimes RM30k gets approved when RM50k doesn't

**Extend tenure:**
- Longer repayment = lower monthly payment
- Ask for maximum tenure to reduce DSR impact
- You can always pay extra later

### Option 4: Joint Application

Add a co-applicant (spouse, parent, sibling):
- Combined income considered
- Both credit records checked
- Both responsible for repayment

## The Credit Card DSR Problem

Credit cards kill your DSR even if you pay in full:

**Example:**
- Credit limit: RM20,000
- Outstanding: RM0 (you pay full)
- What bank calculates: 5% × RM20,000 = RM1,000 monthly commitment

**Solution:**
1. Call bank to reduce credit limit
2. Close unused credit cards
3. Keep only 1-2 cards with reasonable limits

<Callout type="info" title="Before You Apply">
Reduce credit card limits 1-2 months BEFORE applying for a loan. Banks see your current limits, not your spending habits.

## DSR Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Low DSR (Approved Easily)

**Income:** RM6,000 net
**Debts:**
- Car loan: RM600
- Credit card (5% of RM5,000): RM250
- Total: RM850

**DSR:** 850 ÷ 6,000 = **14.2%** ✅

Can easily take a RM50,000 personal loan (adds ~RM1,100/month → new DSR 32%)

### Example 2: Borderline DSR (Needs Strategy)

**Income:** RM4,500 net
**Debts:**
- Car loan: RM900
- Personal loan: RM500
- PTPTN: RM300
- Credit card (5% of RM10,000): RM500
- Total: RM2,200

**DSR:** 2,200 ÷ 4,500 = **48.9%** ⚠️

New RM20,000 loan (RM500/month) → new DSR 60%. Borderline — might need to reduce credit card limit first.

### Example 3: High DSR (Likely Rejected)

**Income:** RM3,500 net
**Debts:**
- Car loan: RM800
- House loan: RM1,000
- Credit card: RM400
- Total: RM2,200

**DSR:** 2,200 ÷ 3,500 = **62.9%** ❌

Already at 63% — most banks will reject any new loan. Needs to pay off something first or increase income.

## When to Consider Alternatives

If your DSR is above 70% and you still need funds:

1. **Licensed money lenders** — Accept higher DSR (up to 80%)
2. **Refinance existing loans** — Consolidate into one lower payment
3. **Pawn shops** — No DSR check, asset-based
4. **EPF withdrawal** — Your own money, no debt added

## DSR Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1:** Hiding existing debts
- Banks check CCRIS — they'll see everything
- Hidden debts = automatic rejection + blacklist

**Mistake 2:** Applying to multiple banks at once
- Each creates an inquiry on your record
- Multiple inquiries = looks desperate = rejection

**Mistake 3:** Not checking DSR before applying
- Calculate first, apply only when confident
- Rejection stays on record for 12 months

**Mistake 4:** Ignoring credit card limits
- High unused limits still hurt your DSR
- Reduce limits before applying

## Bottom Line

DSR is simple math that determines your loan approval:

1. **Calculate yours today** — Know where you stand
2. **Below 50%** — You're in good shape
3. **50-60%** — Be strategic, choose banks carefully
4. **Above 60%** — Work on reducing debt first
5. **Above 70%** — Need alternative approaches

Don't waste applications on loans you can't get. Fix your DSR first, then apply with confidence.
