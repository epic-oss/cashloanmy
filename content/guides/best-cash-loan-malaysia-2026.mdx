- **Existing debts**: Calculate your DSR
- **Urgency**: How fast do you need the money?

### Step 2: Compare Total Cost

Don't just look at interest rate. Calculate **total repayment**:

**Example: RM20,000 loan for 5 years**

| Lender | Rate | Monthly | Total Paid | Total Interest |
|--------|------|---------|------------|----------------|
| GXBank | 3.78% | RM367 | RM22,020 | RM2,020 |

| Licensed | 18% | RM508 | RM30,480 | RM10,480 |

### Step 3: Check Hidden Fees

| Fee | Typical Amount | Notes |
|-----|----------------|-------|
| Processing fee | 0-4% | Some banks waive this |
| Stamp duty | 0.5% | Required by law |
| Late payment | 1%/month | Avoid by paying on time |
| Early settlement | 0-3% | Some allow free early payment |

### Step 4: Apply Strategically

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't Apply Everywhere">
Each loan application creates a CCRIS inquiry. Too many inquiries (3+ in 3 months) can hurt your approval chances. Apply to ONE best-match lender first.
</Callout>
