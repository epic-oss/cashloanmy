| Loan Amount | RM500 - RM10,000 |
| Tenure | 3 - 6 months |
| Approval Time | Minutes to 24 hours |

## How Nimbura Works

## Interest Rates & Fees

<Callout type="warning" title="Understand the True Cost">
Loan apps often display rates differently than banks. A "low monthly rate" can mean high annual interest. Always calculate total repayment.
</Callout>

**Estimated rates:**

|----------|---------------|
| Interest Rate | 18% - 36% p.a. |
| Service Fee | 1% - 6% |
| Late Payment | RM10-50 + daily interest |

### Cost Example

RM3,000 loan for 6 months at 30% p.a.:
- Monthly payment: ~RM545
- Total repayment: ~RM3,270

Not terrible for small amounts, but adds up for larger loans.
