## What is Atome?

Atome is a Singapore-based fintech company operating across Asia. Originally a BNPL platform (split purchases into 3 payments), they've expanded into cash loans called "Atome Cash" or "Atome Credit."

**Company Background:**

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| Headquarters | Singapore |
| Founded | 2019 |
| Backed by | Ant Group (Alibaba affiliate) |
| Markets | Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, others |
| Main product | BNPL, now also cash loans |

**Atome Cash Quick Facts:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Loan Type | Personal cash loan |
| Loan Amount | RM500 - RM5,000 |
| Tenure | 1 - 6 months |
| Approval Time | Minutes (for existing users) |
| Platform | Atome mobile app |

## How Atome Cash Works

1. **Download Atome app** from Play Store or App Store
2. **Create account** — verify with IC and phone
3. **Build history** — use BNPL feature first (recommended)
4. **Access cash loan** — option appears for eligible users
5. **Select amount and tenure** — see repayment schedule
6. **Accept terms** — confirm loan details
7. **Receive funds** — disbursed to linked bank account

<Callout type="tip" title="Eligibility Hack">
Atome cash loans are easier to access if you've already used their BNPL service and paid on time. Build a track record first with small BNPL purchases before applying for cash.

## Atome Cash vs Atome BNPL

| Feature | Atome BNPL | Atome Cash |
|---------|------------|------------|
| What you get | Split purchase into 3 | Cash to bank account |
| Cost | Usually 0% if on time | 12-24% p.a. interest |
| Tenure | 3 payments over 2 months | 1-6 months |
| Use case | Shopping | Any purpose |
| Late fees | Yes | Yes |

**Pro tip:** If you need to buy something, use BNPL (often 0%). Only use Cash Loan when you need actual cash for things like rent, bills, or emergencies.

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I get Atome Cash without using BNPL first?**
A: It's harder. Atome prefers users with payment history. Use BNPL a few times first.

**Q: How fast is disbursement?**
A: Usually within hours for approved applications, sometimes minutes.

**Q: What if I can't repay on time?**
A: Contact Atome before due date. Late fees apply, and it affects your future access.

**Q: Does Atome check CCRIS?**
A: They may do soft checks. Their algorithm also uses your Atome usage data.

**Q: Can I have BNPL and Cash Loan at same time?**
A: Yes, but your total limit is combined. More BNPL usage = less cash loan available.

## Verdict

**Atome Cash is one of the better loan app options** in Malaysia. It's not the cheapest (banks are), but it's far more reasonable than predatory daily-rate apps.

**Best for:**
- Existing Atome users
- Small, short-term needs
- Those who want a trustworthy fintech option

**Rating: 3.5/5** — Good option in the loan app category, but check bank eligibility first.
