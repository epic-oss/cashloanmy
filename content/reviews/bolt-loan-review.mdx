## What is Bolt Loan?

Bolt Loan is a digital lending platform offering quick personal loans through a mobile app. It targets Malaysians who need fast access to cash without traditional bank requirements.

**Quick Facts:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Loan Type | Personal loan |
| Loan Amount | RM1,000 - RM15,000 |
| Tenure | 3 - 12 months |
| Approval Time | Minutes to same day |
| Platform | Mobile app |

## How Bolt Loan Works

1. **Download** Bolt Loan app from Play Store/App Store
2. **Register** using IC and phone number
3. **Fill application** — personal, employment, income details
4. **Verify identity** — IC photo and selfie
5. **Link bank** — some apps require e-banking access
6. **Get decision** — usually within hours
7. **Accept offer** — review terms carefully
8. **Receive money** — disbursed to bank account

## Interest Rates & Costs

<Callout type="warning" title="Calculate Total Cost">
Don't just look at monthly payments. Calculate total repayment to understand true cost. Loan apps are almost always more expensive than banks.
</Callout>

**Typical fee structure:**

| Fee Type | Estimated Range |
|----------|-----------------|
| Interest Rate | 15% - 33% p.a. |
| Processing Fee | 2% - 5% |
| Late Payment | Daily penalty + fixed fee |
| Early Settlement | Usually allowed, check terms |

### Real Cost Example

RM8,000 loan for 12 months at 24% p.a.:
- Monthly payment: ~RM753
- Total repayment: ~RM9,036
- Total interest + fees: ~RM1,036

**Compare:** Same loan from bank at 8% p.a. would cost ~RM340 in interest. That's RM700 difference.

## Requirements

**Who can apply:**
- Malaysian citizen with MyKad
- Age 21-55 (varies by app)
- Minimum income RM1,500/month
- Employed or self-employed with proof
- Active bank account

**Documents typically needed:**
- IC (front and back, clear photo)
- Selfie holding IC
- 3 months bank statements
- Pay slip (employed) or business proof (self-employed)

## Is Bolt Loan Safe?

**Safety checklist:**

| Factor | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| Official app | Download only from Play Store/App Store |
| Company registration | Should be SSM registered |
| No upfront fees | Never pay before receiving loan |
| Transparent terms | Rates shown before you accept |
| Contact info | Real office address and phone |

<Callout type="danger" title="Scam Alert">
Scammers create fake apps or WhatsApp accounts pretending to be legitimate lenders. Never share IC or bank details outside official apps. Never pay "processing fees" upfront.
</Callout>

## What Users Say

**Positive feedback:**
- "Got approved in 2 hours when I needed emergency cash"
- "App is easy to use, straightforward"
- "Helped when bank rejected me"

**Negative feedback:**
- "Interest is high, ended up paying a lot more"
- "They call a lot when payment is due"
- "Wanted access to my contacts — uncomfortable"
- "Hard to reach customer service"

## Best Use Cases

**When Bolt Loan makes sense:**
- True emergency (medical, car repair)
- Small amount needed (under RM5,000)
- You have a repayment plan
- Banks already rejected you
- Short-term need (pay back quickly)

**When to avoid:**
- You qualify for bank loans
- Borrowing for wants, not needs
- Already have existing debt
- No clear repayment plan
- Long-term financing needed

## Alternatives to Consider

Before using Bolt Loan, compare:

| Option | Pros | When to Use |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Bank personal loan | 6-8% interest | If you qualify |
| TNG GOpinjam | Up to RM10k, trusted brand | If you're active TNG user |
| AEON iCash | Reasonable rates | If you're AEON member |
| Credit card | Already have it | Small amount, pay back fast |
| Licensed money lender | Larger amounts, in-person | Need RM20k+ |
| Family/employer | Interest-free | If possible |

## App Permissions — What's Normal?

Loan apps request permissions. Here's what's reasonable:

| Permission | Reasonable? | Why They Want It |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Camera | Yes | IC and selfie verification |
| Storage | Yes | Upload documents |
| Location | Maybe | Fraud prevention |
| Contacts | Suspicious | Collection purposes — be wary |
| SMS | Suspicious | Reading OTPs — risky |
| All photos | No | Unnecessary invasion |

<Callout type="tip" title="Protect Yourself">
If an app demands access to contacts, call logs, or all photos, think twice. Some predatory apps use this data to harass you or your contacts if you miss payments.
</Callout>

## How to Use Bolt Loan Responsibly

If you decide to proceed:

1. **Borrow only what you need** — Resist taking maximum
2. **Read all terms** — Know exact interest and fees
3. **Calculate total cost** — Not just monthly payment
4. **Set calendar reminders** — Don't miss due dates
5. **Pay extra when possible** — Reduce interest
6. **Don't reborrow** — One loan at a time
7. **Screenshot everything** — Keep records

## Verdict

**Bolt Loan is a functional quick-cash option** but comes with the typical downsides of loan apps: high interest and aggressive collection.

**Bottom line:**
- Legitimate for emergencies
- Expensive for anything else
- Last resort, not first choice

**Rating: 2.5/5** — Use only when you truly have no better option.
